light and dark
 + duck
 + camera angles
 + cursed buffs

- lights turn off rhythmically
- enemies' eyes and platforms are only visible in the dark
	- or silhouettes

- light switches -- puzzle platformer
	- darkness changes gameplay
	- mobs only spawn in darkness?
	- sunlight hurts mobs?
	- windows, rays, pillars of light
	- lead mobs towards light to kill them?
	- bright areas have different mobs that can't navigate in the dark?
	- light and dark mobs fight each other?
	- flashlight is your weapon?
	- mirrors spread and direct light
	- light torches to illuminate platform map?
	- puzzles are centered around illuminating the map for your traversal?
		- torches / braziers
		- fire arrows
		- electric lights / switches
		- windows / "curtain" switches
		- glowing mobs
		- lava

		- locked doors, need key
		- gates, need switch
		- switch activates one item, deactivates another
		- push blocks - opens one path, closes another
		- mob guarding light source
		- light generating mob behind gate

start with:

- torches
- platform tiles
- level completion condition (all lights on / brightness threshold?)
- simple mob (walking)


- uncover map as you explore?
	- land becomes lit after you see it?
